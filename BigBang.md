# Kivy Days - BIG BANG - “My sun sets to rise again.” 

_“My sun sets to rise again.” - Robert Browning_

Today I've decided to restart my Kivy study.

I was inspired to do something that I only knew about after I see the twit of [Ana](https://twitter.com/ananoterminal/status/1116141708520185857) about her [100 days of code](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).

"_Great idea_" - I thinked at time. Next that I think - "_it's not for me, someone who barely can keep discipline to read a little, daily, a book_".

But here we are. If you think in do something like that, don't think much.

If you want to have more inspiration, Ana make a [medium article](https://medium.com/ananoterminal/week-01-100-days-of-code-f1500348e003) about her journey.

I didn't read, but I think must be good. Some day I will, maybe.

My first contact with Kivy was years ago.

Started with [The Kivy portal](https://kivy.org/) and in 2013 I read the book [Kivy: Interactive Applications in Python](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/kivy-interactive-applications-python)

Thanks to this book I code a little. At end I could ran on my tablet the Invaders project using [QPython](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.qpython.qpy) android application.

I was ok. 

I like Python a lot, so at this begin I insisted with Kivy.

Even using Windows at this time, it was not a problem. I did things like a kind of [settings to help run Kivy applications on Windows](https://pastebin.com/8HtCWMJR)

But at end, I given up after struggle with attempts  on my own that was a little bit more complex to me.

I given up with the same excuse, the falacity about productivity, easy tools, the way of thinking: a one click away of your all application.

So all this years passed and now I think in do it slowly, in little pieces and deep, inspired by this challenge above, but with more flexibility. :smirk:

So let's began!


# The Setup

## Tools

- Hardware:
  - Notebook LG
  - 8 GB Ram
  - 256 SSD
  - Video Adapter: Intel Corporation UHD Graphics 620
  - O.S. **Antix** 17.4.1 

It's not reference for anything, just to satisfy some curiosity.

- Software:
  - [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.7.3
    - installed by [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
  - [Kivy](https://kivy.org/) 1.10.1
    - on a [virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv)
  - IDE: [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
    - using [KV Lang Auto-completion and Highlighting](https://github.com/kivy/kivy/wiki/Setting-Up-Kivy-with-various-popular-IDE's#kv-lang-auto-completion-and-highlighting)

I did this setup days ago, my Big Bang :boom:

I run touchtracer demo and works flawlessly.

The first few days, I will follow the Youtube Channel [11Wills11](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjxrE6D_P9X_HnSW2mpw1BQ).

He did a playlist [teaching Kivy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsMpSZTgkF5AV1FmALMgW8W-TvrfR3nrs) in Brazilian-Portuguese contain 41 videos.

So, if I keep some discipline, the first 41 days are ready to go!

So let it be light! :sparkles:
