- Kivy is a framework to develop applications
  - to any platform
    - **Desktop** computers: Windows / OSX / Linux
    - **Mobile** devices:  Android / IOS
    - and **TUIO** (*T*angible *U*ser *I*nterface *O*bjects)
  - using GPU to performance

So...

- You will need [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- You will need [Kivy](https://kivy.org/)

Obviously, but I won't tell you how.

There is a huge section about Kivy installation below, very well explained.

- [Kivy Download](https://kivy.org/#download)
  - Windows [install](https://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation-windows.html)
  - Linux [install](https://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation-linux.html)
  - OSX [install](https://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation-osx.html)
  - and much more options...

And I hope you **already** familiar with Python.

For this day, the video is quite simple. Just show about:

- what is Kivy
- how to install on Archie Linux
  - my installation is different from the one made in the video
    - I installed using: _pip_ 
    - instead of using a package manager offered by my Linux
- how code a simple example that creates a window with a button within.

On my this day code I will prefer just create a window, initially.

```python
from kivy.app import App


class Day001(App):

    pass


Day001().run()

```

As you see, to just show an empty window is just:

1. import _App_ class from _kivy.app_
2. The class definition must have just the _pass_ keyword
3. **instantiate** your class and call method _run_ in follow

A window with black background will show.

The third step I struggle a little, because I was missing to instantiate.

I just did: 

```
Day001.run()
```

Like method _run_ was a static method.

Until I see the I should have parentheses (to instantiate), some minutes was lost.

Next, I should do:

- [ ] a deep look on App class

Til there! :raising_hand_man:
